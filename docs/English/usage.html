        <h1>How to Use Chainsaw Human Typing</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Chainsaw Human Typing is designed to simulate human typing in various scenarios. Follow these steps to effectively use the application:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Open the Application:</strong> Launch the application from your desktop or start menu. You will be greeted with the main interface of the application.</li>
                <li><strong>Enter Text:</strong> In the main window, you will see a text area where you can type or paste the text you want to simulate. This text will be used by the application to simulate typing.</li>
                <li><strong>Configure Settings:</strong> Below the text area, you can configure several settings:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Delay:</strong> Set the delay in seconds before starting the typing simulation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interval:</strong> Set the interval between keystrokes. This determines how fast the typing simulation occurs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chars per Stroke:</strong> Choose the number of characters to type at a time before pausing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Randomize Interval:</strong> If checked, the application will randomize the interval between keystrokes to simulate human typing more accurately.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mistake Percentage:</strong> Set the percentage of mistakes to introduce in the typing simulation. Mistakes include typos, backspaces, and corrections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Type Enter:</strong> If checked, the application will simulate pressing the Enter key when it encounters newline characters in the text.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Start Typing:</strong> Click the "Start Typing" button to begin the simulation. The progress will be shown in the progress bar.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop Typing:</strong> If you wish to stop the simulation, click the "Stop Typing" button. This will halt the typing process immediately.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Chainsaw Human Typing also supports presets so that commonly used settings can be stored and easily reused</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose Desired Settings:</strong> With the application running, set all the values for the preset that you would normally use.</li>
                <li><strong>Save Preset:</strong> Click the "Save Preset" button and enter a name for the preset. This will save the current settings for future use in presets.json.</li>
                <li><strong>Load Preset:</strong> To load a preset, double click it from the preset menu and it will load in all the previously selected values.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete Preset:</strong> To delete a preset, select it from the preset menu and press "Delete Preset".</li>
                <li><strong>Rename a Preset:</strong> Presets can also be renamed by selecting them and pressing the "Rename preset" button.</li>
            </ol>
